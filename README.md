## Abstract 
The Smart Laptop Bag is an epiphany designed by us and we intend to built an actual prototype of the same using an actual laptop bag and integrate our systems into the same by determining the accurate position where they can do the best job. All the data that is collected will be analysed, processed and converted into useful information like Live Location, Step Count, Calories Burnt, Temperature and Humidity values in order to suggest the user for harsh environments etc. Apart from that the bag will have certain safety systems like an audio alert system in case you bag is lost, water alert in order to tell if your bag is placed in water by mistake or there is some kind of water seepage in your laptop bag.

Apart from that all the data will be stored on the cloud and be made available to the user by the means of an Android app that will be built up by scratch. Also, the user can control several parameters of the bag remotely via the app.

The most Important Feature will be an SOS system that sends an alert to the concerned people just in case you are in trouble and press up the SOS button.
